Goal
Build a small production-style web app that lets users:
1 Save short notes or URLs
2 Ask questions over their saved content
3 Get answers powered by a simple RAG pipeline
This forces frontend + backend + async + AI integration + system design — without bloat.
Timebox expectation: 6–12 hours of real work.
Hard cap: 2–3 days calendar time.
Functional Requirements
1. Content Ingestion
1 Add text notes (plain text)
2 Add URLs (fetch page content server-side)
Store: Raw content, Metadata (timestamp, source type). No auth needed. Single-user is fine.

2. Semantic Search + RAG
1 Chunking strategy (simple is fine, but intentional)
2 Embeddings generation (OpenAI, local model, or similar)
3 Vector storage (in-memory, sqlite, or lightweight DB)
4 Enter a question and retrieve top relevant chunks
5 Pass context + question to LLM
6 Return answer with cited sources

3. Frontend
1 Add note / URL input
2 List saved items
3 Ask question interface
4 Display answer + source snippets
5 React with hooks, reasonable state management
6 Clarity over beauty

4. API Design
1 POST /ingest
2 GET /items
3 POST /query
4 Evaluate request/response shape, error handling, input validation, naming sanity

Non-Functional Expectations

Tradeoff Awareness
1 Chunking approach rationale
2 Vector store choice
3 What breaks at scale
4 Production changes
Debuggability

1 Structured logging
2 Clear error messages
3 Sensible HTTP status codes
Code Quality

1 Separation of concerns
2 No god files
3 No copy-paste soup
4 Clear naming

Tech Constraints (Aligned With Your Stack)
Backend: Node + Express or FastAPI, OpenAI or equivalent API, SQLite / in-memory / simple vector
store

Frontend: React, Tailwind optional, shadcn optional

Avoid: Full auth systems, Kubernetes theater, Overengineering infra
